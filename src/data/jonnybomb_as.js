I did all the design and development for this (HTML/CSS/Javascript), making a single page webapp with Backbone.js that utilizes the Javascript FileReader API for reading files and Actionscript and the flash plugin for writing files to the local file system.<br/><br/><p>I also made a small one-page scroller promotional site for the mental modeler, where new users could register for free access to the tool, as well as a similarly styled one-page scroller site for the Principal Investigator's UMass Boston Human-Environment Interactions Lab.
