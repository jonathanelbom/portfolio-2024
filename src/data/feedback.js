I'm impressed by how quickly he produced high-quality prototypes/code in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>Jonathan is responsive and communicative; he has answered and started many discussions in #myjobs-team slack and is a frequent knowledge sharer during the team's demo meetings <br/><br/>Moreover, Jonathan has brought many fresh ideas and critiques to the table. Sometimes when working on a feature for too long, a group of people can be inside a bubble and start to rationalize things, and it's enlightening when someone comes and says: wait, this doesn't make sense and is confusing to the job seekers. Jonathan has brought this enlightenment to the team.<br/><br/>Jonathan has also brought a lot of improvements to the engineering side of things. With his guidance and contributions, we are using code closer to Indeed standards by adopting the Indeed DS components; we are also closer to industry standards by adopting proper front-end coding practices in new features.<br/><br/>Jonathan is the perfect part in bridging the gap between UX and dev and improving things on both sides.",
